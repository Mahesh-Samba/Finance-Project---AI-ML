Building a logistic regression model for credit card fraud detection involves creating a binary classification system that predicts whether a transaction is fraudulent or legitimate. Logistic regression is a robust statistical method suitable for binary outcomes, making it ideal for this task. The model uses transaction features, such as amount, time, location, and other relevant data points, to estimate the probability that a given transaction is fraudulent.

The data preparation phase is crucial and typically involves data cleaning, handling missing values, and feature engineering to create meaningful predictors. Since fraud detection deals with highly imbalanced datasets, where fraudulent transactions are much rarer than legitimate ones, techniques such as oversampling, undersampling, or using synthetic data generation methods like SMOTE (Synthetic Minority Over-sampling Technique) are often employed to balance the dataset.

The logistic regression algorithm calculates the weights of each feature by maximizing the likelihood of the observed outcomes. It outputs probabilities, which can be thresholded to classify transactions as fraudulent or not. Performance evaluation of the model is typically done using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and the area under the ROC curve (AUC-ROC), with particular emphasis on recall and precision to avoid false negatives and false positives, respectively.

After training, the model should be validated using a separate test set or cross-validation techniques to ensure its generalizability to unseen data. If the model performs well, it can be deployed in a production environment to monitor and flag potentially fraudulent transactions in real-time. Continuous monitoring and periodic retraining are necessary to adapt to evolving fraud patterns and maintain the model's effectiveness. 

Overall, logistic regression provides a transparent and interpretable approach for fraud detection, allowing financial institutions to not only detect fraudulent transactions but also understand the underlying factors contributing to fraud, thereby enhancing their ability to prevent future occurrences.
